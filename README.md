## Inspiration
Inspired by popular tools like Quizlet, Visual Ease generates customised flashcards that pair terms with vivid images, optimising the study experience for users.


## What it does
**Dynamic Flashcard Generation**

Input any term-definition pair, and Visual Ease creates a visually appealing flashcard complete with a relevant image. This feature harnesses the Picture Superiority Effect, which states that people are more likely to remember information presented as images rather than text alone. By associating each term with a striking visual, users can enhance their recall.

**Text File Segmentation**

Users can upload large text files, and the application will intelligently segment the content to extract terms and definitions. For each term, Visual Ease generates a corresponding image, making it easier to digest extensive material in manageable chunks.

**Analogy and Metaphor Imagery**

To further support memorization, Visual Ease offers the unique capability to create analogy or metaphor images. For example, when learning about parts of the brain, the app might depict the brain as a house, with each part representing different rooms. This taps into Eidetic Memory, a phenomenon where individuals can recall images with high precision. By crafting these metaphorical visuals, users can deepen their understanding and retention of complex concepts.

Visual Ease transforms traditional study methods by integrating visual learning principles, making it an invaluable tool for students, educators, and lifelong learners alike. Whether you're preparing for exams or seeking to master new topics, Visual Ease empowers you to learn with ease and efficiency.

## Challenges we ran into
During the hackathon, our team encountered several challenges that tested our technical skills and collaboration. One major hurdle was sourcing specific AI tools that aligned with our project needs, particularly finding tokenized APIs with low processing times. We spent considerable time researching and evaluating various options to ensure they would effectively support our dynamic flashcard generation feature. Additionally, managing Git branches proved tricky as we worked across different platforms, necessitating clear communication to prevent conflicts. Connecting API keys to our backend and ensuring seamless integration between API requests and frontend elements, such as buttons and user responses, required meticulous attention to detail. This intricate process of linking all components underscored the importance of teamwork and adaptability in overcoming obstacles and achieving our project goals.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
1. Two of our teammates were beginners, and this project provided them with a valuable learning opportunity. They gained new knowledge, learned programming languages, and successfully applied these skills to the project.
2. Another significant achievement was creating a solution that effectively supports students who benefit from visual learning aids.
3. Everyone played an active role in the team, from defining the problem space to coding the website and paying attention to finer details.
4. Additionally, we are really proud of how interactive and efficient our website's frontend turned out to be.

## What we learned
During the hackathon, we gained valuable experience in linking APIs directly to frontend components. We also learned how API tokens function and how to generate tokens for open-source APIs. Moreover, we developed the skill of identifying and selecting appropriate APIs from various available resources to meet our project requirements.

## What's next for VisualEase
For future improvements, we envision several enhancements to elevate the user experience and functionality of Visual Ease. One significant enhancement would be integrating the GPT API, allowing users to engage with a conversational AI that helps them explore specific concepts in depth. This feature would streamline the learning process, enabling users to ask questions and receive tailored explanations, thereby reducing their effort and increasing efficiency. Additionally, we aim to refine the analogy API to improve its performance, ensuring that the generated metaphorical images resonate more effectively with users and enhance their understanding of complex topics. Another improvement we aim to integrate in VisualEase is the ability to link specific images to corresponding flashcards to provide the user with compact learning tools that incorporate both text and images and enchance learning experience. Together, these improvements will make Visual Ease an even more powerful tool for learning and retention.
